# Only add code here if you need:
# - Rotation to face movement direction
# - Visual effects
# - Collision detection with other snakes
# - Color changes
# - Size variations

# Example: Rotate body part to face its movement direction
func _process(delta):
	# This would require the Snake script to pass velocity/direction info
	pass
